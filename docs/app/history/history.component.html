  <p>Sansukumi-ken (三すくみ拳) is a category of East Asian hand games played by using three hand gestures. Ken games went 
    into a period of decline in Japan after World War II. One of the few surviving sansukumi-ken games is jan-ken, 
    which was brought to the West in the 20th century as rock-paper-scissors.</p>
